# Background
[comment]: <> (what your project is, what its objectives are, and what the status of the project was at the time of the last reporting. A good example: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hgomes/cse237d/ProjectProgressReport.pdf)
Following the orginal work of Ian Goodfellow on ["Generative Adverserial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf), and consequently the work of several researchers from the University of Michican on ["Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05396.pdf), this project focuses mainly on Image Systhesis (Hallucinating Images) and further explore its applications.
